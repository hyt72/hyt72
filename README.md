Hi, I’m @hyt72 (72 is my birth year -1900). I have been Linux user since 1995.
I started my programming "career" at 1984 with VIC20 basic.
Continued with C64 machine language.
After that was few years of Amiga era and mainly gaming.
1994 first PC with win 3.11 and borland's pascal, and then borland's c ides.
At the end of 1994, I found Linux. I dragged pack of floppies to school everyday in hope that they have been invented "universal" cd-drive-driver.
Before and after they did it, I hade big problems with my 486 DX2 @ 66 MHz, 16 MB of RAM and 420 MB of HD, because XFree86 didn't support Tseng ET400.
So I used my mighty Linux machine in console mode for, at least year. But still, I managed to lure couple of my friends to Linux world.

Now-a-days... Not saying anything but, if there ever be a MS-visual C for Linux, I'm going to buy. (just to check it out)

Code::blocks with Glade/wxWidgets are ... same level than GUI development tools was in 1998.
